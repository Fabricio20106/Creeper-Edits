# Creeper Edits

Creeper Edits is the 5th mod in the Texture Pack to Mod (TtM) series.

Inspired by its respective resource pack, Creeper Edits, this mod adds a new material called "Creeper". This can be used to make armor, tools, buckets
and even horse armor.

There is also a new helmet called "Creeper Lord Helmet" that gives you Resistance for 10 seconds when not underwater (like Turtle Shells).
